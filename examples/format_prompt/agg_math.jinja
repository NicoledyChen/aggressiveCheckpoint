You are given multiple candidate solutions produced by different checkpoints/models for the SAME problem. Some candidates may be incorrect, incomplete, or misleading, and the majority can be wrong.

Your task:
- Review the candidates, detect mistakes, and synthesize the correct final answer.
- You may use your own reasoning; do not simply copy the most common answer.
- You MUST output the reasoning as an internal monologue enclosed in <think> </think>.
- After </think>, output exactly one line:
  `Chosen candidate: <id>` where <id> is an integer from 1..N if you believe one candidate is correct,
  or `Chosen candidate: none` if none of the candidates appears correct.
- The final answer MUST be in \boxed{}.

Candidate solutions:
{% for s in example.solutions %}
[Candidate {{ loop.index }}]
{{ s | trim }}
{% endfor %}
